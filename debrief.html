          Thank you for participating in this research study. The purpose of
          this study was to investigate how individuals perceive faces. You were
          asked to provide a variety of similarity judgments of facial stimuli
          and we intend to understand how participants, such as yourself, make
          these judgments. In particular, we are interested in how individual
          differences &#40;like your race and gender&#41; and target factors
          &#40;like the physical features of the faces&#41; affect how they are
          perceived. Some of the questions we plan to address relate to how
          faces are viewed as members of different social categories &#40;e.g.,
          as biracials, as Asians, or as Latinos&#41;.
